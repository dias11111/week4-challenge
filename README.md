# week4-challenge

• What was the challenge?
-Create a calculator and implement all the functions.

• How I expected the challenge to go.
- The challenege did take time and I had to play around with it to make work but I was expecting the challenge 
to be more difficult but with prevoius learning I was able to solve all the issues and make it work.  


• What went well?
- I really enjoyed doing this challenge because I understood what I had to do and how to implement the fucntion. 
Last 4 weeks of learning helped me a lot to do this challenge because I the structure 
and function and all I had to do is think about the logic and make it work.  

• What didn't go as planned?
